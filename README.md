# ami-preservation
NYPL's Preservation of Audio and Moving Image (PAMI) team performs reformatting to provide long-term preservation and access for our audiovisual collections. 

This repository contains the resources, tools, internal handbooks that support digitization, quality assurance, and quality control processes within the PAMI workflow.
