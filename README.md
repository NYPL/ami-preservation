# ami-preservation
NYPL's Media Preservation teams perform reformatting to provide long-term preservation and access for our audiovisual collections. This repository contains the resources, tools, internal documentation that support digitization, quality assurance, and quality control activities within the AMI workflow. Use the following links to navigate to various tools stored in the repo:

## [AMI Digitization Scripts](https://github.com/NYPL/ami-preservation/tree/master/ami_scripts)

## [AMI Documentation Site](https://nypl.github.io/ami-preservation/)
### Documentation Site Installation and Development
