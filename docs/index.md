# NYPL Audio and Moving Image (AMI) Preservation Documentation Portal
The Audio and Moving Image Preservation team is part of the Preservation and Collections Processing department at The New York Public Library (NYPL).

This site provides documentation for the unit's programmatic workflows, including command-line instructions for various tools and step-by-step instructions for carrying out in-house and outsourced audio and moving image digitization and reformatting activities.

Scripts and tools referenced in the documentation can be found within [ami-preservation on GitHub](https://github.com/NYPL/ami-preservation).
