## Timeline

* Start date: July 2018
* Target end date: 2021
* Target item count: 18,789 items (as per 2012 AVPS survey)

## Methodology
With the end goal being digitization by an external vendor, the scale of this project requires a streamlined workflow that prioritizes identification and documentation over conservation treatment. For this reason, the scope of treatment is limited to what can be completed within a reasonable amount of time for each object.

### Selection
Assessment selection varies depending on condition and curatorial priorities.

## Reporting
Progress on film assessment is reported each month for the Digital Collections dashboard.
