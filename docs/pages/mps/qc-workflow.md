# Quality Control Overview
Quality control (QC) is conducted in accordance with best practices to ensure that deliverables generated for preservation and access meet our technical specifications, metadata requirements, and adhere to best practices for handling and digitization of NYPLâ€™s audiovisual collections.

Our QC workflow is currently comprised of the following processes:

  * Fixity check: custom scripts that incorporate Bagit.py
  * JSON validation using ajv
  * MediaConch specification conformance check
  * Manual bag, content, & metadata inspection

Our QC workflows vary slightly between Vendor and In-House deliverables, so the following handbook is divided to reflect that. The following sections will provide step-by-step instructions for carrying out our QC processes.

## Shipment Intake & QC Cheat-Sheet

* Enter all drives and associated invoice IDs ("shipments" / "work orders") received into the [Vendor Project Tracking sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZeF6vGE1TqLnKaNjZFSIvjyKhYBt38nBcZDHyD_saPo/edit#gid=1973090513). Complete all fields (some are formulas - highlighted gray if so).

* Copy the "work order ID" that is automatically generated in the Vendor Project Tracking sheet (column A).

* Create an ICC/Logs directory named with the work order ID

* Create a Trello Card on the [MPS Quality Control Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/CBLrQvG1/nypl-ami-quality-control-and-ingest) and paste the work order ID into the Title of the card.

* Create a QC log in the Team Drive QC Folder for each hard drive:
  * make a copy of the [QC Log Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OKlFNGR27H6Ey9v2EyAjqe6MzOsPrVl_5X4PDV-elsU/edit?usp=sharing) & rename the copy using the same work order ID, (follow the QC log template naming convention).

* Attach the QC log to the associated Trello card (using the Attachments button in the card, drop in the URL of the QC log).

### Mount Drive Read-Only **(vendor only)**

The most important step during QC is to mount your drive(s) [Read-Only](https://github.com/NYPL/ami-preservation/wiki/Resources#mounting-drives-read-only).
   * Open Disk Utility and check the Device name listed in the lower right corner

   * Mount a drive read-only using the following command: 
   ```
   diskutil mount readOnly device name as listed in Disk Utility
   ```

### Validate Packages

Use ```validate_ami_bags.py``` in ami-tools (Run ```/path/to/validate_ami_bags.py -h``` for additional usage)
```
python3 /path/to/ami-tools/bin/validate_ami_bags.py -d /Volumes/driveID/ --metadata --quiet
```
* Review any Bags that report as "not ready for ingest"

or...just validate JSON using one of two options:

### JSON Validation

```
/path/to/ami-preservation/ami-scripts/json_validator.py -m /path/to/ami-metadata -d /Volumes/DRIVE-ID
```
or

```
ajv validate --all-errors --multiple-of-precision=2 --verbose -s /path/to/ami-metadata/versions/2.0/schema/digitized.json -r "/path/to/ami-metadata/versions/2.0/schema/*.json" -d "/Volumes/DRIVE-ID/*/*/data/*/*.json"
```

### Check File Specifications 

Use ```mediaconch_checker.py``` in ami_scripts to test media files against MediaConch polices

The ami-preservation repo contains a directory, [qc_utilities](https://github.com/NYPL/ami-preservation/tree/master/qc_utilities). Within this are various scripts and tools, including the mediaconch scripts listed below which will generate 'pass/fail' logs in your home directory when run against a directory of media files.
```
/path/to/ami-preservation/ami-scripts/mediaconch_checker.py -p /path/to/ami-preservation/qc_utilities/MediaconchPolicies -d /Volumes/DRIVE-ID
```

### Validate Bags
```
path/to/ami-tools/bin/validate_ami_bags.py --metadata --slow -d /Volumes/driveID/
```
* Log destination is home/user directory. Check Bag validation logs for errors. Resolve / log any errors (in QC log) and continue.

* **AUDIO ONLY**: Check a selection of FLAC for embedded metadata
  * Copy 5 .flac files delivered to Desktop and decode these new copies back to wav.
```
flac --decode --keep-foreign-metadata --preserve-modtime --verify input.flac
```
  * Check BEXT in newly decoded .wavs using BWF MetaEdit. **Discard .wavs and .flac copies after use.**

* **FILM PMs ONLY**:
  * Check a selection of PMs for RAWCooked reversability:
```
/path/to/ami-preservation/ami-scripts/rawcooked_check_mkv.py -d /Volumes/DRIVE-ID 
```

### Perform Manual QC 
  * Perform manual QC using Google Sheet list of Bags to check (in Trello card) (1min @ beginning, middle, end of each file)
  * Note any errors / observations in the Google Sheet log. Use the categories/menus provided as much as possible.

* After manual QC, **if all bags are valid**...Then:

  * Pull MediaInfo & output the resulting mediainfo.csv log to the directory for your project or HD on ICA

```
python3 /path/to/ami-preservation/ami_scripts/mediainfo_extractor.py -d /Volumes/DRIVE-ID -o /path/to/destination/folder/WorkOrderID.csv
```

* Wrap Up...
  * Move the Trello Card to the proper list (passed / failed etc.)
  * IF APPROVED:
    * Update QC status and check Due date in Trello Card; Move the Trello Card to the passed list; stage HD for delivery to Digital Preservation
    * Database: update database for approved shipments

  * IF NOT APPROVED
    * Mention MPC in Trello card for follow-up OR email vendor with QC feedback / issues (or send feedback to Manager to relay to vendor); include relevant CMS IDs or filenames.
&
    * Move Trello card to "Vendor: QC Review" or "IN-HOUSE: QC Review" list in Trello.
    * Vendor: MPC follow up with vendor about errors and resolve before approving shipments. 
    * In-house: Tag relevant engineer and MPC, and Manager on Trello Card. 
    

## Vendor Deliverables
For Vendor deliverables, QC is primarily performed directly on hard-drives.

### JSON Validation
Run the following in Terminal to check if JSON is valid against the appropriate schema:
```
ajv validate --all-errors --multiple-of-precision=2 --verbose -s /path/to/ami-metadata/versions/2.0/schema/digitized.json -r "/path/to/ami-metadata/versions/2.0/schema/*.json" -d "/Volumes/DRIVE-ID/*/*/data/*/*.json"
```

### Media specification validation (MediaConch)
Use either [MediaConch CLI](https://github.com/NYPL/ami-preservation/wiki/Resources#mediaconch) or [MediaConch GUI](https://github.com/NYPL/ami-preservation/wiki/Resources#mediaconch) to make sure files meet NYPL specifications.

### Generating a QC list
Use Terminal to generate a QC list for each drive you are QCing by following the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/NYPL/ami-preservation/wiki/Resources#generating-a-qc-list).

### Content Inspection
Content inspection can be completed either on ICC or on the drive by following the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/NYPL/ami-preservation/wiki/Resources#content-inspection).  

### Locate & Open QC log

**Each QC log should be easily found linked in Google Drive as an** _attachment in the Trello Card for the batch you are inspecting._ **If not, check with MPA.** _Tip: you can search for the drive ID / work order ID in the Trello search box._

  * Use the list of files that appears in the Google Sheet QC log (in the QClog tab) as your list of files to check.
  * Drop down menus are available for noting specific identifiable errors, and there is a free-text field for general notes.

#### Spot Checking Content & JSON
Use a text-editor (Atom / Notepad / Text Edit etc.) to [open and inspect](https://github.com/NYPL/ami-preservation/wiki/Resources#spot-checking-content--json) JSON files.

#### Logging QC Failures & Flags
Use [this](https://github.com/NYPL/ami-preservation/wiki/Resources#logging-qc-failures--flags) list of definitions to review and mark-off the items listed in the QC log.

#### Media Ingest Preparation
Follow these [steps](https://github.com/NYPL/ami-preservation/wiki/Resources#media-ingest-preparation) to prepare media for ingest.

## Tools
See our [Command Line Resources ](https://nypl.github.io/ami-preservation/pages/resources.html)for descriptions, usage, and installation instructions of various tools we use in this workflow.
