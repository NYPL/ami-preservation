The Preservation Services team supports NYPL's preservation activities by managing outsourced digitization logistics, pre-digitization conservation, and digital asset quality control and migration. Our team works closely with Media Preservation Labs, Digital Preservation, Digital Archives, Preservation and Collections Processing, and Curatorial teams to ensure that media are prioritized for reformatting and conservation treatment, and that all deliverables meet standards-based technical requirements prior to long-term preservation and access. Additional services include technical specification development, workflow documentation, and administrative management of grant-funded media preservation projects.

## Services

### Physical Media Assessment
In preparation for digitization and long term storage, physical analog media undergo basic conservation and rehousing, carried out by the Media Preservation Services team. Formats currently covered by this team include film and grooved discs.  

### Oursourced Digitization
NYPL utilizes external vendors for high-volume, grant-funded digitization projects, focusing on at-risk audiovisual media identified within the scope of NYPL's Audio and Moving Image Preservation Initative.

### Quality Control
Following digitization / reformatting (of digital media on physical carriers), digital assets are delivered to and reviewed by MPS. This process includes automated validation of packaging, metadata, and technical specifications, plus manual review of content to check for errors which cannot be discovered by our automated systems, such as audio sync and analog artifacts.

### Digital Asset Ingest Staging
Once digital assets are approved, they are staged in our ingest queue, which is managed by NYPL's Digital Preservation department.
