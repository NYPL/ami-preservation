# AMI Metadata Overview
{: .no_toc }

Every digitization project at NYPLâ€”whether performed in-house by the Audio and Moving Image Preservation Lab or by an external vendorâ€”is supported by structured metadata. This overview outlines how descriptive, technical, and process metadata are created, managed, and delivered across the digitization workflow.

## Pre-Digitization: SPEC Export

For each digitization batch, a metadata spreadsheetâ€”referred to as the SPEC exportâ€”is generated. This spreadsheet includes descriptive fields provided by the Collection Management System (SPEC) and is delivered to either:

- The AMI Preservation Lab for in-house digitization, or  
- A vendor for outsourced digitization.

In the AMI Preservation Lab, this metadata is imported into FileMaker prior to digitization and forms the base record for each object.

## Post-Digitization: Technical & Process Metadata

Following digitization, each object's FileMaker record is updated with:

- Technical metadata (e.g., bit depth, duration, codecs)  
- Digitization process details (e.g., transfer path, hardware used)  
- Signal condition notes

The completion of this step is critical to producing accurate and validated metadata exports.

## JSON Metadata Generation

Once technical and process metadata have been added to FileMaker:

- Each record is exported as a structured JSON file.  
- These JSON files accompany each digital Preservation Master, Edit Master, Mezzanine, or Service Copy file.  
- JSON metadata follows the specifications defined by [`ami-metadata`](https://github.com/NYPL/ami-metadata), NYPLâ€™s open schema for audiovisual materials.

## Workflow Automation with Python

The Lab uses a Python-based toolchain to automate the following:

- Derivative generation (Edit, Mezzanine, Service Copy)  
- FileMaker record duplication for derivatives  
- Technical metadata extraction and insertion into FileMaker  
- JSON file creation and validation  
- Object packaging and BagIt creation
