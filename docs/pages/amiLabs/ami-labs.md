# AMI Labs
NYPL's in-house media preservation unit digitizes thousands of audio and video recordings per year, with a primary focus on performing closely monitored transfers of the following: new Library acquisitions, cataloging priorities, labor-intensive media, and select on-demand requests (for exhibitions and programs, public orders, and special needs). Growing out of the individual preservation units of specific curatorial divisions (the Jerome Robbins Dance Division, the Theatre on Film and Tape Archive, and the Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound), in 2009 NYPL consolidated these groups under the banner of Preservation of Audio and Moving Image (PAMI). Today, the AMI Labs are part of Digital Collections Services, within the  Digital Research Division.

The following pages detail workflows, policies, and procedures for audio/video digitization, optical media migration, and born-digital processing, broken into the following categories:
   * Pre-digitization conservation treatments
   * Set-up and monitoring during transfer
   * Post-digitization editing, spot-checking, and packaging
   * Quality control
   * Safe and secure file transfer

Members of the AMI Labs include:
  * Rhony Dostaly, Media Preservation Engineer, Video (<francisdougherty@nypl.org>)
