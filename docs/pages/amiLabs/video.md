## Pre-digitization conservation treatments
Before developing a conservation plan, media objects must first go through a detailed assessment process, a form of "triage" in which tapes are separated and grouped according to degradation symptoms and potential treatment paths.

The problematic videotape is, most likely, a cassette, and this effort to accurately gauge the condition of a tape prior to playback is a key first step in preparing for optimal digitization. Keep in mind: despite the attention paid to each item during acquisition and initial archival processing, a member of the AMI Labs will likely be the first person to bring an extensive empirical background to the assessment and inspection of these objects. Ultimately, it is the variety or uniformity of a group of tapes that will dictate the subsequent plan of action.

### Triage and sorting
* Item-level check-in&#151;the first phase of triage/sorting&#151;is a sequence of steps designed to confirm that all items listed within a Work Order have been received and are logged properly in the AMI Database. This process involves the following:
  * Opening the AMI Database and searching within a production layout for the Work Order ID (Click ```Find ``` located in the top toolbar)
  * Reconcile all items with corresponding database entries, looking for any omissions, additions, or format misidentifications
  * Check all physical objects for two identifying numbers: barcode and CMS ID. These numbers are typically affixed to the case or cover.
  * Take care not to separate the tape from its case.

### Cleaning

#### Cleaning machines

#### Bench cleaning cassette without disassembly
* The AMI Labs (Room C-04) are equipped with a bench vacuum that has a set micro-attachments ideal for cleaning videotape cassette guides prior to transfer. To use effectively, first place a set of weights on either side of the cassette shell to secure the tape in an upright position, resting along its spine.
* Next, hold the cassette flap open with an Ethafoam log and carefully remove a generous loop of contaminated leader and tape.
