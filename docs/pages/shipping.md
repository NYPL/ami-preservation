* "Straight truck" required, no more than 27" off ground (dock ceiling is short)
* Lift gate required, ideally ~94" x 70" ("tractor trailer" or “gesticulating” lift gates are preferred to accommodate the incline of the dock floor.
* Dock is 29" high from the ground, and only 19.5 ft long; outside of loading dock is a steep incline - short truck required.
