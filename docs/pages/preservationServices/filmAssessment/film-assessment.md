# Film Assessment

The goals of the film assessment program are to gain greater physical and intellectual control over the Research Library film collections, in preparation for digitization, long-term storage, and digital preservation. Serving both in-house and outsourced digitization streams, the selection process is informed by various factors, including condition, element type, and curatorial priority.
