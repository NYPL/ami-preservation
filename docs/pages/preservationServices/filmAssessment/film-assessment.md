# Film Assessment
The Film Assessment program is an initiative funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation which aims to carry out item-level assessment of film collections held in the Library's Research Divisions. Assessment work takes place at Library Services Center in Long Island City, Queens, in collaboration with the Archives and Preservation and Collections Processing departments.

The goals of the assessment are to gain greater physical and intellectual control over the Research Library film collections, in preparation for digitization, long-term storage, and digital preservation. Serving both in-house and outsourced digitization streams, the selection process is informed by various factors, including condition, element type, and curatorial priority.
