The Preservation Services team facilitates NYPL's preservation efforts through coordination of outsourced digitization, pre-digitization conservation, and the management of digital asset quality and migration. Responsibilities also extend to the creation of technical standards, documenting workflows, and overseeing the administrative aspects of grant-funded preservation projects.

### Physical Media Assessment
In preparation for digitization and long term storage, physical analog media undergo basic conservation and rehousing.  

### Vendor Digitization
NYPL utilizes external vendors for high-volume, grant-funded digitization projects, focusing on at-risk audiovisual media.

### Quality Control
Following digitization, digital assets reviewed, a process which includes automated validation of packaging, metadata, and technical specifications, plus a manual review of content to check for errors that cannot be discovered by our automated systems (such as audio sync and analog artifacts).

### Digital Asset Ingest Staging
Once digital assets are approved, they are staged in our ingest queue, which is managed by NYPL's Digital Preservation department.
