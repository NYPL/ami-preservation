The Preservation Services team facilitates NYPL's preservation efforts through coordination of outsourced digitization, pre-digitization conservation, and the management of digital asset quality and migration. Responsibilities also extend to the creation of technical standards, documenting workflows, and overseeing the administrative aspects of grant-funded preservation projects.

### Physical Media Assessment
In preparation for digitization and long term storage, physical analog media undergo basic conservation and rehousing, carried out by the Media Preservation Services team. Formats currently covered by this team include film and grooved discs.  

### Oursourced Digitization
NYPL utilizes external vendors for high-volume, grant-funded digitization projects, focusing on at-risk audiovisual media identified within the scope of NYPL's Audio and Moving Image Preservation Initative.

### Quality Control
Following digitization / reformatting (of digital media on physical carriers), digital assets are delivered to and reviewed by MPS. This process includes automated validation of packaging, metadata, and technical specifications, plus manual review of content to check for errors which cannot be discovered by our automated systems, such as audio sync and analog artifacts.

### Digital Asset Ingest Staging
Once digital assets are approved, they are staged in our ingest queue, which is managed by NYPL's Digital Preservation department.
