# Quality Control Overview
{: .no_toc }

Our quality control (QC) workflow leverages both automated and manual processes to ensure that digital assets meet our specifications. We perform automated QC on 100% of our deliverables, and manual QC on approximately 10-15%.

Our workflow incorporates the following open source tools:

* Ajv: an open source JSON schema validator
* BagIt: an open source tool for verifying file fixity and adherence to the BagIt specification
* Flac Utility: An open source tool for lossless compression / encoding / decoding of audio files to the Free Lossless Audio Codec
* Isolyser: an open source tool used to verify size of ISO 9660 image against Volume Descriptor fields
* MediaConch: an open source specification conformance checker which uses Mediainfo
* Mpv: an open source cross-platform media player
* QCTools: a software tool that helps users analyze and understand their digitized video files through use of audiovisual analytics and filtering
* RAWCooked: an open source tool for lossless compression / encoding / decoding of DPX image sequences
