# Quality Control Overview
{: .no_toc }

Our quality control (QC) workflow leverages both automated and manual processes to ensure that digital assets meet our specifications. We perform automated QC on 100% of our deliverables, and manual QC on approximately 10-15%.

Our workflow incorporates the following open source tools:

* [Ajv](https://ajv.js.org/): an open source JSON schema validator  
* [BagIt](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8493): an open standard specification for packaging digital content; [bagit-python](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-python) is a commonly used implementation  
* [FLAC Utility](https://xiph.org/flac/): an open source tool for lossless compression / encoding / decoding of audio files to the Free Lossless Audio Codec  
* [Isolyzer](https://github.com/KBNLresearch/isolyzer): an open source tool used to verify the size of ISO 9660 images against Volume Descriptor fields  
* [MediaConch](https://mediaarea.net/MediaConch): an open source specification conformance checker which uses MediaInfo  
* [mpv](https://mpv.io/): an open source, cross-platform media player  
* [QCTools](https://bavc.github.io/qctools/): a software tool that helps users analyze and understand their digitized video files using audiovisual analytics and filters  
* [RAWcooked](https://mediaarea.net/RAWcooked): an open source tool for lossless compression and reversible encoding of DPX image sequences into Matroska
