# AMI Metadata Overview
{: .no_toc }

A metadata spreadsheet ("SPEC export") is created for each digitization batch, which is then delivered to either the Preservation Labs, for in-house digitization, or to a vendor for outsourced digitization. This spreadsheet includes only the fields provided by SPEC prior to digitization, and is imported by the digitizer. Following digitization, this existing metadata is combined with new technical and digitization process information and each record is exported as individual JSON files that accompany each digital audio or video file produced. 

## [JSON / ami-metadata](https://github.com/NYPL/ami-metadata)
* JSON metadata requirements are defined in NYPL's JSON schema, ami-metadata, hosted on GitHub.
