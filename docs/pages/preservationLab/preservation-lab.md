# Preservation Lab
{: .no_toc }

The Preservation Lab serves as NYPL's dedicated in-house unit for digitizing audio and moving image materials, focusing on high-priority tasks such as transferring new acquisitions, cataloged items, labor-intensive media, and fulfilling on-demand requests. The following pages detail workflows, policies, and procedures for audio/video/film digitization, and optical media migration, in the following categories:

   * Pre-digitization conservation treatments
   * Set-up and monitoring during transfer
   * Post-digitization editing, spot-checking, and packaging
   * Quality control
   * Safe and secure file transfer

## Software

Our workflows favor free/open source software (FOSS) for their flexibility and efficiency in media digitization processes.
