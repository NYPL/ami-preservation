## Overview
- **Objective**: Assess and prepare videotapes for digital conversion.
- **Scope**: Includes acquisition, processing, preservation, and access steps.
- **Attention**: First detailed examination of the tapes with little context provided.
- **Skillset Required**: Empirical assessment and critical observation.

## Initial Sorting
- **Project Alignment**: Verify the tapes against the FileMaker database using project ID.
- **Inventory Check**: Identify any omissions, unexpected additions, or misidentified formats.
- **Tape Identification**: Maintain the pair of the barcode and CMS number with the tape.
- **Tape-Case Unity**: Avoid separating the tape from its case. If separation is necessary, attach a temporary ID with a Post-it noting the CMS number.

## Work Area Preparation
- **Space Requirement**: Arrange for a long, uninterrupted horizontal space.
- **Physical Examination**: Closely examine each tape for mismatched cases and labels.
- **Tape Assessment**: Identify tapes by their physical characteristics such as the manufacturer, stock ID, and estimated age.
- **Incubation Categorization**: Set aside any tapes requiring incubation (e.g., sticky tapes, especially from Ampex).

## Sorting by Playability
- **Playable Brands Checklist**:
  - **Fuji**
  - **3M**: Exclude older stocks with treatable particulate issues.
  - **Maxell**
  - **Eastman**
  - **Sony**: Only post-1984 opaque gray cases are considered playable.
- **Unplayable Brands Checklist**:
  - **Sony**: Pre-1984 with clear cases.
  - **Memorex**: Noted as sticky, prioritize for incubation.
  - **Ampex and Quantegy**: Also prioritize for incubation if sticky.
  - **DuPont**: Same approach as Ampex.
  - **Agfa**: Handle with caution due to unstable conditions.

## Inspection Process
- **Preliminary Checks**: Perform an initial assessment before cleaning.
- **Tape Mechanism**: Unlock the cassette flap and ensure the tape is properly wound.
- **Ethafoam Use**: Insert Ethafoam logs to keep the flap open without touching the tape.
- **Hub Confirmation**: Confirm the tape's attachment to the hub by manually rotating the take-up hub.

## Cleaning Protocol
- **Machine Familiarization**: Get accustomed to RTI cleaning machines for different formats.
- **Cleaning Tape Replacement**: Follow instructions under the hinged cover for replacement.
- **Path Maintenance**: Regularly clean the tape path and guides.
- **Operation**: Use the CLEAN and AUTO functions and observe the tape's movement.
- **Troubleshooting**: Note any shedding or particulate exudation during the cleaning cycle.

## Essential Tools
- **Screwdriver**: Phillips head for disassembly.
- **Cutting Tools**: Razor blade for labels and splicing.
- **Splicing Equipment**: Blocks and tape for 1/2 inch and 3/4 inch formats.
- **Cleaning Supplies**:
  - **Ethafoam**: Custom-cut for tape support.
  - **Alcohol**: Isopropyl at 99% for cleaning.
  - **Swabs**: Cotton with wood sticks for precision.
- **Precision Tools**:
  - **Bamboo Skewer**: For tight spots.
  - **Mat Board Strips**: For awkward spaces.
- **Vacuum**: HEPA with attachments for internal cleaning of cassette shells.

Remember, this process involves meticulous attention to detail and care to prevent damage to the tapes. Use the tools as directed and maintain a clean workspace to ensure the best results for preservation.
