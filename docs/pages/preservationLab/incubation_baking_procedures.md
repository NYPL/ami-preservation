# Incubation and Baking Procedures
{: .no_toc }

This page outlines our current procedures and standards for the incubation (baking) of magnetic media, including both audio and video formats. Tape baking is a preservation intervention used to mitigate binder hydrolysis and other forms of degradation prior to playback and digitization.

### Equipment

We use two scientific ovens for tape baking:

- **Thermo Scientific Thelco 70M (Model 6550)**  
- **Thermo Scientific Heratherm OMS180**

Both ovens are dedicated to media preservation and allow for precise temperature control during extended baking periods.

---

### Baking Temperatures

Our standard baking temperature has increased over time:

- **Previous standard**: 125°F / 52°C  
- **Current standard**: 135°F / 57°C

The 125°F setting proved insufficient for many tape stocks. After testing, we raised the temperature approximately 10°F to improve effectiveness across a wider range of materials.

### Duration by Format

#### **Audio Tapes**

- **Previous**: 7” and 10” reels were typically baked for 30–60 minutes  
- **Current**: Now baked for **2–3 hours**, depending on reel size and quantity

#### **Video Tapes**

- **VHS**: ~20 hours  
- **U-matic**: 20–24 hours  
- **Open reel video**: ~24 hours

Bake times vary based on the format and severity of degradation.

### Format Considerations

#### **Audio**

In addition to reel-to-reel tape, we now also bake:

- **Cassette tapes**, particularly Ampex
- **Early audio recordings on video formats**, such as:
  - U-matic
  - 8mm
  - VHS
  - Betamax

#### **Video**

We now bake a broader range of U-matic stocks. Key guidelines include:

- **Fuji U-matics**: Generally do **not** require baking  
- **Sony U-matics (Red/Yellow label)**: We **do** bake  
- **Ampex U-matics**: We **do** bake

Formats we typically **do not bake**:

- Metal Evaporate (ME) tapes  
- 8mm formats  
- DV formats  
- Digital Betacam

### Format-Specific "Recipes"

#### **Audio**

Bake time depends on the number and size of reels in the oven. For instance, multiple 10” reels of ¼” tape require proportionally longer durations. The relationship is not fully linear and is often determined through trial and error.

Anecdotally, **Agfa tapes** may benefit from slightly lower temperatures, but we’ve found **135°F** to be broadly effective across most brands.

#### **Video**

No additional format-specific baking recipes beyond the general guidelines listed above.

### Known Problematic Brands

#### **Audio**

- **Analog**:
  - Ampex (post-1970)
  - Certain Scotch stocks (e.g., 250)
  - Agfa (e.g., 468)
- **Digital**:
  - Ampex/Quantegy
  - Sony
  - Some Scotch

See [Richard Hess’s website](http://richardhess.com) for detailed, brand-specific information.

#### **Video**

- **Ampex U-matics**: Consistently require baking and respond well  
- **Sony U-matics**: Results vary; some tapes exhibit **white particulate shedding** that does **not** respond to baking

---

### Workflow Adjustments and Observations

- **2" multitrack audio tapes** often require **double** the bake time compared to standard reels  
- Tapes that have undergone **multiple baking cycles** may reach a point of irreversible degradation  
  - These tapes often exhibit **high-frequency loss** that cannot be recovered through additional baking

This document reflects current practices based on staff experience and ongoing observation. Procedures may continue to evolve as formats degrade and new preservation challenges emerge.
