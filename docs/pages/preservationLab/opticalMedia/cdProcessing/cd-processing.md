# CD Preservation Workflow and Processing Guide
{: .no_toc }

This documentation covers our evolving approach to CD processing, encompassing both standard and edge-case workflows for different types of discs. While our primary focus has been on extracting high-quality WAV files from Audio CDs using ISOBuster and the Nimbie disc robot, we also encounter Data CDs and hybrid formats that require alternate tools and handling strategies. In addition to our core procedures, we are actively evaluating tools like Redumper for potential use in specialized preservation scenarios. Each page in this section provides step-by-step instructions, tool-specific guidance, and notes on exceptions or edge cases that fall outside our routine workflows.
