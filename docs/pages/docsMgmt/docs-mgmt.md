# Documentation Policy and Content Management

The PAMI Documentation Site is a static website. PAMI staff will add documentation to the site via a repository on [PAMI's GitHub](https://github.com/NYPL/ami-preservation) that is designated for that set of documentation. A static site generator called Jekyll converts the raw text files that comprise the documentation (ie. Markdown files) to HTML, and the site files will be deployed to nypl.github.io/ami-preservation.

GitHub is a web-based hosting service that enables version-control of content, meaning that it records and saves the changes to files over time and enables users to recall specific versions of those files. Please refer to [GitHub's documentation guides](https://guides.github.com/) for more information on Git and GitHub.
