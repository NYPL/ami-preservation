# AMI Housing Guidelines

Collection Management (CM) is responsible for accessioning AMI—including separating media from paper materials—as well as rehousing items for permanent storage at ReCAP. These guidelines focus on housing strategies that protect the material and streamline AMIP’s digitization workflow, understanding that items may be reorganized for storage efficiency after the digitization process is complete.

### General Guidelines

* **Workflow Priority:** Housing decisions should prioritize the safety and accessibility of the media for the digitization team. Consolidation for maximum ReCAP storage density can be performed post-digitization if necessary.
* **Container Efficiency:** AMI items should be combined into the fewest number of containers appropriate for their size without overcrowding.
* **Workflow Separation:** To avoid digitization workflow disruptions, do not box migrated and unmigrated items in the same container.
* **Identifiable Issues:** AMI items with immediately identifiable issues (mold, blank media) must be boxed separately.
* **Collection Grouping:** AMI items should be boxed together by collection. Collections with too few items to fill a box may be combined with AMI from other collections, provided they belong to the same **division**.

### Format-Based Guidelines

* **Group by Type:** Items can be grouped by general type rather than specific format.
    * *Example:* VHS and U-matic tapes can be boxed together (Analog Video).
    * *Example:* Analog audio cassettes and digital audio cassettes (e.g., DATs) must be housed separately.
* **Digital Video:** DV tapes (most commonly MiniDV) should be kept separate from other digital video formats (such as D-1, D-2, and D-3) as their capture process is distinct.
    * *Note:* Use smaller archival boxes for formats like MiniDV, maxing out at ~100 items per box rather than larger record cartons (~300-400 items). This improves tracking and simplifies digital file management.
* **Digital Audio on Video Tape:** Many digital audio formats were recorded on videotape (e.g., PCM 1610/30 (U-matic), PCM-F1 (Betamax/VHS), DA-88/DA-98 (8mm), and ADAT(VHS)).
    * *Check for Markings:* If a videotape has markings indicating a kHz sampling rate (e.g. 44.1 or 48), bit depth (e.g. 12 or 16), or track range (e.g. 1-8, 9-16), it should be treated as a **digital audio** item and separated from standard videotape formats.
* **Film:** Film follows a separate workflow beginning with inspection by the AMIP Film Inspection Team at LSC, who prepare, pack, and coordinate logistics for digitization.
* **Glass Discs:** Glass-based lacquer discs require special packing and **will not** go to ReCAP.

### Housing Specifications by Media

| Media Type | Orientation | Container | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Film on cores**<br>(35mm / 16mm) | Horizontal | Record Carton | Inspection and digitization handled by the Film Inspection Team at LSC.<br>Ultimate storage: Cold Storage at ReCAP. |
| **Film on reels**<br>(8mm / Super8) | Vertical | Record Carton | Inspection and digitization handled by the Film Inspection Team at LSC.<br>Ultimate storage: Cold Storage at ReCAP. |
| **Magnetic Media Reels** | Vertical | Record Carton | Place individual tape boxes in the record carton so that pulling a box out will not cause the reel or inner sleeve to fall out. |
| **Cassette Tapes** | Vertical | Cassette Box | A record carton can accommodate 3 cassette boxes.<br>Ensure added labels do not prevent the case from opening smoothly. |
| **VHS Tapes** | Vertical | Record Carton | |
| **Optical Media** | Vertical | CD/DVD Box | If a case contains multiple discs stacked on top of one another, rehouse into a multi-disc case (e.g., 2-disc or 4-disc case). |
| **DV Digital Video** | Vertical | Cassette Box | Keep separate from other digital video formats. |
| **Mini DV** | Vertical | Cassette Box | Max ~100 items per box. |
| **Digital Audio Tapes** | Vertical | Cassette Box | **Watch for:** U-matic PCM 1610/30, PCM-F1, DA-88, ADAT.<br>Separate if markings indicate kHz, bit depth, or track ranges (1-8, etc.).<br>Ensure added labels do not prevent opening. |
| **Grooved Media**<br>(Discs/Cylinders) | Vertical | *Various* | **Glass Lacquers:** Special pack required; do **NOT** send to ReCAP. Handle with utmost care.<br>**Other Discs:** Store vertically with padding/bubble wrap.<br>**Cylinders:** Use approved cylinder boxes. Handle as fragile; sensitive to temp/shock. |

### Oversize Items

**Motion Picture Film**
* **16mm and 35mm:** Any film cans larger than 1,200 ft capacity should be sent to ReCAP as individual items.

**Magnetic Media**
* **Open Reel Video:** 1”+ reels that are 12+ inches in diameter (i.e., cannot be stored upright in a standard Paige record carton) should be sent to ReCAP as individual items.
* **Open Reel Audio:** Reels that are 12+ inches in diameter (i.e., cannot be stored upright in a standard Paige record carton) should be sent to ReCAP as individual items.
