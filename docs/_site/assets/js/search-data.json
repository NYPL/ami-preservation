Digital Asset Deliverables . “Digital asset” is defined as a group of files resulting from digitization, and describes a single NYPL collection object with a single unique identifier. All digital assets must meet the provided specifications and packaging requirements. Specifications may be modified over time to reflect changes in best practices or NYPL’s digital infrastructure, or to accommodate unexpected media formats, configurations, or conditions. The following chart provides an overview of what files are expected within digital assets produced for each media type: . Files Film Video Audio Data . Preservation master file (pm) | x | x | x | x | . Edit (em) or mezzanine (mz) master file | x |   | x |   | . Service file (sc) | x | x |   |   | . Metadata file (for each media files) | x | x | x |   | . Images | x | x | x | x | . Sidecar files (gz, scc, cue, etc.) | as specified | as specified | as specified |   | . BagIt manifests | as specified | as specified | as specified | as specified | . . Metadata . . NYPL Metadata inventory . NYPL will provide the vendor with a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet containing identifying and descriptive information about each NYPL collection object included in the PO. Note that one collection object with a single unique primary id may contain multiple physical objects (for example: a double compact cassette case). . . NYPL JSON schema . NYPL metadata deliverables must adhere to customized fields and controlled vocabulary defined within NYPL’s JSON Schema. The schema, sample files, and validation instructions are hosted on GitHub: (https://github.com/NYPL/ami-metadata) . Metadata must be packaged as a single JSON file for each audio, video, or film media file (Images do not require JSON metadata). | Metadata must validate against JSON schema. Any invalid files or errors will be corrected by the vendor and require redelivery of an entire Bagged digital asset. | Metadata files must be named with the same root as the media file to which they pertain, but must not include the original extension of the media file. Example: Correct: [filename].json | Incorrect: [filename].mov.json | . | . The vendor will be responsible for the following: . maintaining a system that is able to easily sync with and incorporate updates from NYPL’s live GitHub repository, ami-metadata, and | generating metadata about the source object, preservation master and derivative files, treatment and digitization processes, and the transfer operator. | . . Metadata content . The required contents of the metadata files are defined by the JSON metadata schema. According to that schema, metadata will be produced for each deliverable that includes the following designated categories: Bibliographic (provided by NYPL) | Source (partially provided by NYPL) | Technical | Digitization process | Digitizer | . | Metadata must use the only the fields and values defined in the schema. | If there is a question about a field, if the provided vocabulary does not accurately describe an object or process, or if a list of terms is insufficient, contact NYPL for guidance on how to proceed. NYPL may approve and release new terms on the schema depending on priority. | Metadata fields must not be empty. Refer to the schema or contact NYPL for allowances of “unknown” as a value. | . . Metadata notes fields . The metadata schema includes a number of ‘notes’ fields which must be used as described below: . bibliographic.accessNotes: NYPL added. No additional input required | bibliographic.contentNotes: any additional content notes (“title program ends mid-tape, followed by another program”; “contains explicit content”) | technical.signalNotes: audiovisual signal characteristics noticed during capture (“tracking errors; audio buzz”) | source.notes.physicalConditionDigitizationNotes: description of pre-existing damage or decay not already noted in PreShip notes (“broken leader”; “bad splices”) | source.notes.physicalConditionPreShipNotes: NYPL added. No additional input required | digitizationProcess.notes.processNotes: rehousing, adding leader, baking, cleaning | . . Metadata errors . If the technical characteristics or format of an object have provided by NYPL are incorrect (i.e. metadata inventory describes the format as “video cassette analog” and it is actually “audio cassette digital” with a format of “Umatic/PCM”), please | provide corrected metadata. Make any changes to source object metadata elements that would be appropriate, and note the correction in the “digitization.notes.processNotes”. Example text: “NYPL-provided metadata incorrectly listed [insert field name here] as [insert wrong content here]; JSON reflects correct [field name]” | . | . . BEXT Metadata . The following BEXT metadata must be captured in the original Broadcast Wave files to ensure retention in the final FLAC deliverable. . BEXT field Explanation Sample data . Description | Description of who created the file | File generated by Vendor Services, US | . Originator | Country code, Institution | US, The New York Public Library | . OriginatorReference | technicalFileName | myt_123456_v01f01_pm | . OriginationDate | Date file created in YYYY-MM-DD format | 2017-06-23 | . OriginationTime | Time file created in hh:mm:ss format | 11:20:47 | . BextVersion |   | 1 | . CodingHistory | Signal chain from which the digital file was created, starting with the analog or digital source. There are six elements that can be included in the coding history: 1. A = coding algorithm (analog, PCM, etc.) 2. F = sampling frequency in Hz 3. B = bit rate (for MPEG only) 4. W = word length or bit depth 5. M = mode or sound field (mono, stereo) 6. T = free text to describe playback and capture equipment | A=PCM,F=44100,W=16,M=stereo,T=TSSTcorp DVDRW SH-216BB; Compact DiscA=PCM,F=44100,W=16,M=stereo,T=dBpoweramp 14.3; Import CDDA as WAV | . . Images . All magnetic and optical media and enclosures must be photographed in order to capture significant bibliographic annotations or other content. Film will not be photographed. . . Image file naming convention . Image files should follow the same pattern as the media files, and be placed in the Images directory, at the same hierarchical level as the PreservationMasters and EditMasters directory: division_PrimaryID_v#f# (front/back/top/bottom/left/right/etc).jpg . PrimaryID Data PreservationMasters | EditMasters | Images division_PrimaryID_v01f01.jpg | division_PrimaryID_v01f02.jpg | division_PrimaryID_v01_front.jpg | division_PrimaryID_v01_back.jpg | division_PrimaryID_v01_side1.jpg | division_PrimaryID_v01_side2.jpg | . | . | . | .

Surfaces | All enclosures: Front, back, top, bottom, left side, right side (if applicable) | . Notes | Images with text or content to which ‘orientation’ applies should be oriented correctly (i.e. for the language in which any text is written); If sides, top, or bottom do not have content, do not capture. If media object itself has extensive labeling, please include media alongside enclosure in applicable photographs (i.e. side of tape with side of case in the same shot). | . . Digital Asset and Hard Drive Structure . . Hard drive structure . Sort digital assets according to source object media types. Each hard drive must contain a directory at the root level that specifies the media type. Each media type directory must only contain completed digital assets (Bags). If a media type directory is present, it must contain digital assets (empty directories are not acceptable). Name root directories using the following terms where applicable: . Audio | Video | Film | Data | . No hidden files may be stored on the drive or within the subdirectories or Bags (including .DS_Store, Trash or Recycling Bin, thumbs.db), and these files must not be listed in any manifests. . . Digital asset packaging . Package digital assets using the BagIt specification (V0.97) (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8493). . Bag Requirements The Bag payload must contain the digital assets organized within a directory structure described by NYPL. | The Bag directory must be named with the Primary ID of the collection object represented by the files in the bag. | The Bag must contain an md5 manifest that lists every file in the data directory and their md5 checksums. | The Bag must contain all of the media and metadata files from one, and only one, inventoried collection object. | The Bag should be created with a tool using BagIt Library 4.4 or higher. | The Bag may include a tagmanifest.txt file. Some bagging software produces this file automatically. It is not required to produce or delete these files. | The Bag and the files within it must not be compressed with zip, tar, etc. | . | Subdirectories Sub-directories must be exactly named as they are written here, in plural form, regardless of the number of files within the directory. | Film Bags must contain the following subdirectories within the data directory: PreservationMasters | Mezzanines | ServiceCopies | Images | . | Data Bags must contain the following subdirectories within the data directory: PreservationMasters | Images . | Files | For each preservation master file in the PreservationMasters directory, corresponding derivative file/s must exist. | Each audio, film, video media, or data file in the Bag must have a corresponding JSON metadata file (image files do not require metadata). | . | Example structure: NYPL000001 2017_001_jones1_hdmanifest_20171201.xls | Audio division_PrimaryID data Images division_PrimaryID_v01f01.jpg | division_PrimaryID_v01f02.jpg | division_PrimaryID_v01_front.jpg | division_PrimaryID_v01_back.jpg | . | PreservationMasters division_PrimaryID_v01f01_pm.flac | division_PrimaryID_v01f01_pm.json | division_PrimaryID_v01f02_pm.flac | division_PrimaryID_v01f02_pm.json | . | EditMasters division_PrimaryID_v01f01_em.flac | division_PrimaryID_v01f01_em.json | division_PrimaryID_v01f02_em.flac | division_PrimaryID_v01f02_em.json | . | bag-info.txt | bagit.txt | manifest-md5.txt | tagmanifest-md5.txt | . | . | . | . | . | . | . . File naming convention . NYPL will provide the vendor with a filename “root” for each collection object, consisting of a three-letter prefix, the primary ID, a volume number (and a face number for audio objects), and a two-letter suffix indicating the role of the file. These sections are each separated by an underscore: (prefix)_ primary ID)_ (components) _ (file role).ext . Video example: myd_123456_v01_pm.mkv | Audio example : myh_987654_v01f01r01_pm.flac . It is the vendor’s responsibility to complete the filename to accommodate multiple volumes, faces, regions, etc. where applicable, as defined by the filename components listed below. . | . . Filename components . A file name must use the following components to represent the portion of a physical media object represented by the file (see “component” chart). Example: | The file representing the second take of the second part of the third stream of the second region of the second face of an object marked as volume 1 is named as myd_259382_v01f02r02s03p02t02_pm.wav. | . Component Use Note . Volume: v## | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Volume is one video or audio object in a set of objects, when that set has been assigned a single primary identifier (i.e. NYPL Primary ID)&lt;/li&gt; | Audio and video | . Face: f## | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Face is a stream or track, or a group of streams or tracks which play synchronously, within an audio object. Every audio object has at least one Face.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some optical video formats are double-sided (rare)&lt;/li&gt; | Audio and video | . Region: r## | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Region is a subdivision of a Face.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regions are most often defined by a required change in playback characteristics of an object’s Face (speed, EQ, track configuration, color encoding system etc.).&lt;/li&gt; | Audio and video | . Stream: s## | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Stream element is used to describe multi-track and multi-channel audio objects only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Streams are one-channel or interleaved two-channel audio streams which comprise a multi-channel or multi-track audio object.&lt;/li&gt; | Audio only | . Part: p## | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The part element is used when digitization of a single face of an audio or video object requires interruption because the size of the resulting file would exceed technical limits if captured all at once.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The part element may also be used when a single tape contains sections of content that are each given different unique identifiers (rare; each section would be a distinct Part).&lt;/li&gt; | Audio and video | . . File role . A media file name must record its intended role using one of the following suffix codes: . pm: Preservation Master, created for every physical media object | mz: Mezzanine, created for every motion picture film (film groups 1 and 2) | em: Edit Master, created for audio files | sc: Service Copy, created for video files | image files do not require a role suffix | . . Digital Asset Delivery . . Delivery method . New hard drive(s) must adhere to the following specifications outlined by NYPL digital preservation requirements: (https://github.com/NYPL/digpres-policies) mustbe used. | In addition to the naming requirements listed on the linked hard drive specifications, the hard drive ID and volume name must be exactly 10-characters in length (i.e. NYPL000001 or NYPL_12345). | Alternate delivery methods may be explored during term of the agreement. | . . Delivery schedule . Each volume delivered (either FTP directory or external hard drive) must only contain assets for a single purchase order. | Shipment of progress hard drives at regular intervals throughout the Purchase Order timeline is required. An agreed-upon schedule must facilitate ongoing NYPL quality control invoice approval by NYPL staff (rather than a single or small number of large-volume deliveries). Delays in delivery of digital assets will result in extension of allotted NYPL quality control and invoice approval time. | Example schedule: 4 hard drives in a single shipment, every 4 weeks. | . | NYPL must approve the method of shipment for the hard drives. | . . Pilot delivery . Before general production begins on a project, a shipment of “pilot” digital assets must be delivered as follows via FTP: | FTP login information must be provided via email to NYPL project managers at the onset of a given project. | 5 completed Bags each of audio, video, and film assets (15 bags total maximum) | Pilot shipment via FTP must be packaged within a directory that is given a shipment identification number. | Once pilot is approved, the FTP transfer may be considered a delivery, and the FTP transfer must be listed on the associated invoice by its identifying shipment ID (NYPL will identify this shipment using the name of the directory as given by the vendor on their FTP client). | Once pilot assets are retrieved via FTP they will be reviewed in a timely manner by NYPL. Approved assets will be kept by NYPL and treated as progress deliverables (as the first shipment of a given project). | . . Quality Assurance and Quality Control . Great care must be used in the handling of original materials and comply with the standards and best practices established by the International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (IASA). A thorough visual inspection must be completed before playback. . A reformatting signal path must be established through the selection, installation, and calibration of equipment designed to ensure optimal signal transfer. . If any physical problems are detected, either during inspection or playback, contact NYPL with a proposed treatment plan before proceeding. . . Capture Issues . NYPL recognizes that some media may pose challenges to capture or may not be able to be captured due to extremely poor condition or other circumstances. * If media exhibit audiovisual artifacts inherent to their source formats or conditions that impact the quality of transfer, but do not prevent a full capture, such artifacts must be described in the metadata signal notes. * If an object is not captured, the object must be listed in the required ‘did not capture’ (DNC) report, described in the documentation section of this RFP: * DNC report must adhere to the provided template: (https://github.com/NYPL/ami-handling/blob/master/templates/2020_000_example1_didnotcapture_yyyymmdd.xlsx) * Capture Issue Category: Issues that result in an an object not being captured must be described in the DNC report using the following categories, with additional notes provided as needed. If additional categories are required, NYPL must approve before they are used: * playback issue * condition issue * duplicate * blank media * unsupported AMI format * unopened commercial media * Capture Issue Notes: Notes must be added to provide supplemental information about the category issue selected. For example, if the category is “unsupported AMI format”, the notes must describe the format that is not supported and why; if the category is “condition issue”, the notes must indicate what treatments were attempted and failed to facilitate capture. . . Vendor Quality Assurance and Control . Quality control must be performed for all digital assets, prior to delivery, including preservation masters, derivatives, and metadata. The quality control must include, at minimum: . a confirmation that all required files are present and are named correctly; | confirmation of conformance to media file technical specifications; | confirmation of BagIt specification conformance; | a comparison of each file’s technical metadata to its actual technical specifications; | validation of JSON metadata against NYPL’s JSON schema; | a playback inspection of each file covering the beginning, middle, and end of the file; and | confirmation that the delivery hard drive and subdirectories are formatted and structured according to NYPL specifications. | . NYPL Quality Control . Routine process . A quality control process, similar to what is prescribed for the vendor, will be conducted by NYPL within 30 days of receiving each hard drive. | If any errors are discovered after delivery to NYPL, by the vendor, NYPL must be informed as soon as possible. | Delays or interruptions may require extending the 30-day QC window. affecting the initial scheduled deliveries and invoice approvals. | . Rework following QC failures . If any errors are discovered by NYPL during quality control, NYPL will communicate those errors to the vendor, and any necessary rework must be performed by the vendor and digital assets re-delivered at no additional charge. | Small volumes of rework (i.e. up to 10 bags), may be re-delivered via FTP if infrastructure allows. | Extensive rework or redelivery of large volumes of Bags, that exceeds the 30 day QC timeframe will be subject to a new 30-day cycle upon receipt by NYPL. | . . Environment and security . . Physical environment . Physical assets must be stored in an environment that is free of food, water, pests, contaminants, sunlight, and strong magnetic fields. Temperature in the storage area must be between 45-65ºF, with a relative humidity of 30-50%. . . Physical security . Physical assets are considered NYPL special collections. The vendor’s staff and site security methods, described in an AAM General Facilities Report, must meet NYPL approval. . . Digital security . General security and restrictions . Digital assets are considered NYPL special collections and may not be used without express NYPL approval. | The security methods used for the vendor’s digital storage system must meet NYPL approval. | Network based transfers must use encryption in-flight and, if a third-party intermediate storage provider is required, encryption at-rest. | . Project Files . All media files, checksums, and metadata must be maintained for 60 days following NYPL’s quality control approval of all hard drives within a purchase order. | Immediately following this period, confirmation of secure deletion of NYPL digital assets from the any and all storage locations must be provided. | . . Shipment of Physical Media . . General logistics . NYPL shall approve all vehicles and plans for shipping. | Shipment of original physical media both to and from the vendor shall typically be arranged by NYPL, using a shipper selected by NYPL. | . . Project assets . Return of the original media shall occur following successful quality control of the final digital assets covered by purchase order. | It is the vendors responsibility to return the physical media to NYPL per the set schedule in total. If the vendor omits physical media from the scheduled shipment, the vendor shall be responsible for return shipping to NYPL, using a shipping company and method approved by NYPL in writing. | Each shipment must have a packing list that lists the barcode and Box ID of each box included in the shipment. This packing list may be delivered electronically in the format of a searchable PDF document. | . . Treatment, Handling, and Rehousing of Physical Media . . General guidelines . Any treatment action must not result in loss of content. | All costs for supplies and rehousing labor should be included with the cost proposal, as described in the Vendor’s fee schedule. | Replace original housings in these cases: Housing is no longer structurally sound and may compound media damage | Housing is contaminated with mold, pest droppings, etc. | Housing for 3- or 5-inch audio reels have been replaced with 7-inch reels | . | Discard original housings if replaced and meet these conditions: Housing does not contain bibliographic content. | Housing is contaminated with mold, pest droppings, etc. | . | Unless discarded (see discard criteria), all original materials, including tapes, boxes, and reels will be returned to NYPL at the conclusion of the project. | New housings must be clearly labeled with the original primary id, written in indelible archival marker. | If any original media has been rehoused, all components (original plus new housing) shall be packed together in the original container. If some components no longer fit as a result of rehousing, additional containers may be used. Overflow components must be grouped by original container (ensure that original plus new housings remain together). | Overflow container must be clearly labelled with the original objects’ Box ID (example: “MUS 1569”). | Original housings must be clearly associated with the rehoused materials. | . | . . Treatment and rehousing: Film media . . Film handling . Films on cores and in archival cans must be stored flat, horizontally. | Films in shipping containers and on shipping reels may be stored vertically until rehoused to archival cans and cores to prevent damage prior to rehousing. | Films should not be transported via sprockets through any equipment unless for syncing purposes through synchronizers. This should apply to all phases of film work, including winding, inspection, cleaning, scanning. Record footage count through scanning as opposed to synchronizer. | . . Film cleaning . Prior to digitization, if condition of the film allows for cleaning, films shall be cleaned with a solvent approved by NYPL, preferably Perchloroethylene. | Precaution must be used when cleaning films with magnetic sound. Magnetic film cleaning chemicals must be discussed with with NYPL. | Cleaning solvents must not remove NYPL unique identifiers; otherwise, a method for reapplying identifiers to film leader must be proposed by the vendor. | . . Film repair . Repair deteriorated or broken splices and perforations as needed to achieve acceptable image capture. Any repair actions taken must not result in any significant loss of content or annotations beyond what is necessary to achieve capture. Annotations on leader that must be cut off to make a repair must be included in the JSON metadata. | . | Chemical treatment for deshrinking or rehumidification of shrunken, brittle and/or curling film must be approved with NYPL prior to treatment. | . . Film rehousing . Cans and cores: NYPL anticipates that a majority of film objects will be rehoused to archival cores and containers prior to vendor work, but some objects may not be due to their condition. Only objects which have not been rehoused by NYPL may be rehoused. If needed, non-archival containers, shipping reels, and cores must be replaced with archival containers, cores, and/or reels. must comply with the Photographic Activity Test (PAT, ISO18916) | must be approved by NYPL | . | . | Leader: Most film objects will have 20 feet of new leader pre-attached (10 feet at head, 10 feet at tail), labeled with NYPL unique identifiers. * If leader must be added to an object, label the head and tail leader with the objects NYPL unique identifier. | . . Treatment and rehousing: Video media . . Video handling . Record tabs, if present, must be removed prior to digitization. Video cleaning &amp; baking . | If professional-grade cleaning machines exist for a particular video format, they must be used, and the action noted in metadata digitization process notes. Cleaning machines should also undergo regular servicing to ensure that tapes will not be damaged during the cleaning process. | Video formats that regularly fall victim to Sticky-Shed Syndrome, or any other form of binder hydrolysis, should be baked to achieve optimal reformatting. NYPL is open to local baking customs, though these procedures must be communicated in a detailed manner as part of the response to this RFP. Video repair and rehousing . | Treatments such as re-shelling or rehousing should be performed, when needed, by skilled technicians to achieve optimal reformatting. | . . Treatment and rehousing: Audio media . . Audio reel and cassette rehousing:Reels and Cassettes . Slotless hubs are preferred, dependent on funds approval by NYPL. If slotless hubs are not commercially available, reuse the original reel and wind one-eighth inch of leader tape around the hub to minimize the effect of the slot. . Tape on 3-inch and 5-inch reels: Wind onto new 7-inch reels with slotless hubs. | Retain original housing unless it meets housing discard criteria. | . | Tape on 7-inch reels with slotted hubs: Wind onto new 7-inch reels with slotless hubs. | Retain and re-use original housing unless it meets housing discard criteria. | . | Tape on 10.5-inch reels with slotted hubs: Wind onto new 10.5-inch reels with slotless hubs. If 10.5-inch slotless reels are not commercially available, reuse the original reel and wind 1/8 inch of leader tape around the hub to minimize the effect of the slot on the magnetic tape. | Retain and re-use original housing unless it meets housing discard criteria. | Reels should be re-boxed if the original box is damaging to the tape. | If original boxes are causing damage, or if the tape has been re-wound onto a larger reel, original boxes may be replaced with new 2-piece boxes should be constructed of either white paper-board or unbuffered Ph-neutral lignen-free board. Do not substitute polypropylene or other plastic cases unless specifically requested by NYPL. | . | Cassettes: Replace broken shells and cases with new archival shells and cases, as approved by NYPL. | . | . . Treatment and rehousing: Grooved Disc . . Grooved Disc identification and rehousing . Glass discs have a piece of red tape wrapped around the edge. Blue tape below the red tape indicates that the disc is either cracked, chipped, or broken, and should be handled with the utmost of care. | All discs must be rehoused into acid-free and lignin-free buffered paper sleeves approved by NYPL. | Barcodes must be duplicated and affixed to the upper-left hand corner of the new sleeve. | Any IDs should be copied from the old sleeve to the new one in the upper right hand corner | All original materials (including old sleeves) must be returned to NYPL at the conclusion of the project. | . | . . Grooved Disc cleaning . Discs must be cleaned according to procedures appropriate for their type, detailed below. . Cleaning and rehousing of shellac, shellac-vinyl compound, and vinyl discs: Cleaning and drying must be carried out with a disc-cleaning machine suitable for archival discs. | Clean each disc with a solution of distilled water and Photoflo 200 or 600, The Disc Doctor’s “Miracle Cleaner”, or comparable approved product. | . | Cleaning and rehousing details for glass and aluminum based discs: Discs that appear to be relatively clean and in good condition may be cleaned using an archival disc-cleaning machine. | Glass and Aluminum based discs which exhibit “Palmitic Acid Syndrome” must be hand-cleaned. | Aluminum discs: Oxidation may be gently wiped with mineral or castor oil and a lint-free cloth, prior to gentle hand-washing | Glass discs: Oxidation may be cleaned with a solution of non-scented detergent and PhotoFlo (or comparable product approved by NYPL) | Hand-wash with a solution of non-scented liquid soap and PhotoFlo or similar product; rinse with lukewarm water; repeat as needed on both sides; vacuum and dry discs as normal. | . | . . Cylinder cleaning . No wet cleaning of cylinders. Only soft brushes are to be used for cleaning. | . . Cylinder rehousing . All cylinders should be rehoused into buffered board boxes approved by NYPL. The recommended product is the Wax Cylinder Storage Boxes designed under the guidance of the Northeast Document Conservation Center from University Products (#612-0364 for 4” cylinders, #612-0366 for 6” cylinders). | All associated original packaging, papers and ephemera should be included in the separate compartment in each box. | Consult IASA-TC 04, 2nd edition, Chapter 5 for best practices regarding cylinder handling, playback, and rehousing. | .",

Requests for recommendations regarding these objects have been included in the Business Questions section. . . Video media . . Deliverables . For each original recording, the following shall be produced: . One preservation master file If captions are present in source, one closed captions sidecar file | . | One service copy file | One metadata file per media file | Image files as described | . Capture tools Preservation master video files must be generated by professional-grade capture devices and software, with either direct capture to FFV1/FLAC/MKV, or transcoding from V210/PCM/MOV. Specific FFmpeg transcoding recipes will be provided by NYPL to ensure consistency. . . Guidelines: Preservation master files, all groups . Characteristics intrinsic to the broadcast standard of the source material, including frame rate, pixel aspect ratio, interlacing, resolution, and recording standard (NTSC, PAL, SECAM, etc.) should be preserved. | Signal extraction must be optimal, and carried out using the equipment and accessories that are appropriate for the original format characteristics. | The most direct and clean signal path must be used at all times from source to destination. There may be no devices inserted in the signal path that are not being used. If there are multiple destination formats being used in the transfer the signal path must be routed in parallel. No daisy-chaining of devices may occur. | The highest quality signal format (composite, S-Video, Component, SDI, etc.) available for the source media type must be used throughout the entirety of the signal path from source through destination. Exceptions to this must be explained and requested prior to performing the transfer. | Luminance, black, and color levels should be adjusted to existing color bars if they are present on tape and look accurate. If color bars are not present or are clearly inaccurate, preview each tape in order to adjust levels according to the content of the tape using known references (such as blue sky, known blacks and whites, flesh tone, etc.). Luma should be adjusted to fall within broadcast range (100 IRE max) and must not exceed 110 IRE. | The transfer should capture all content recorded on the original object, including any bars and tone, slates, or other material coming before the start of the recorded program. | The recording should run until the end of the recorded content (picture and sound). If this endpoint cannot be unambiguously determined, the recording should run until the end of the original object. | If present on the source tape, closed captions must be captured. | . . Video preservation master sidecar files . Closed captions . If captions are present in source object, an .scc sidecar file must be created and accompany the preservation master file (closed captioning must be embedded in service copies. See service copy specifications). Format: Scenarist Closed Caption File (.scc) | Naming Convention: division_PrimaryID_v01_pm.scc | . | Closed captions specifications may change in the future to accommodate updates to standards or NYPL infrastructure needs. | . . QCTools Reports . Each video preservation master file should receive a corresponding QCTools report, which will be included in the PreservationMasters Bagged directory as a sidecar file. Format: QCTools Report (gzipped XML) (https://www.bavc.org/preserve-media/preservation-tools) | Naming Convention: division_PrimaryID_v01_pm.mkv.qctools.xml.gz | . | . Preservation master file specifications: video group 1: analog and digital cassettes, analog open reel . Attribute Specification . Video codec | FFv1 version 3 | . Data compression | Lossless, Intra-frame (GOP-1) only | . Chroma subsampling | 4:2:2 YUV | . Bit depth | 10-bit | . File wrapper | Matroska (.mkv) | . Frame rate | (Same as original media) | . Frame size | (Same as original media) | . Broadcast standard | (Same as original media) | . Pixel aspect ratio | D1 NTSC (.91) or PAL (1.09) | . Slices | 24 | . Slicecrc | 1 | . Audio format | FLAC | . Audio bit depth | 24-bit | . Audio sampling rate | 48 kHz | . Audio channels | (Same as original media, see guidelines for silent channels) | . . Silent audio channels . If a channel exists and is silent, the channel should be captured and a note should be included in the JSON file that the indicates that the tape and the channels delivered on preservation master file are silent. If a channel is non-existent, then it won’t be captured. For example: | If soundField=”ch.1:mono, ch.2: none” rather than soundField= “mono”, then the second channel exists, and source.audioRecording.numberOfAudioChannels = 2 (and the preservation master file delivered will contain 2 channels of audio, one of which is silent). | Two silent channels If detected as actual channels / i.e. recorded with “black” vs. not recorded), both channels should be captured and delivered with the preservation master, and a signalNote should be included that the tape is silent. | . . Timecode . Two forms of legacy/source timecode should be retained: LTC Timecode, recorded on an audio channel, should be captured as an audio stream in the resulting preservation master file; VITC timecode, if present, should be captured through the use of appropriate playback devices and a carefully routed SDI signal chain. | . Preservation master file specifications: video group 2: DV (digital video) cassettes . NYPL prefers native capture of DV content, with the understanding that errors and varying conditions may require alternative approaches to signal capture. Below are NYPL primary specifications, followed by specifications for cases where the native DV capture with .dv wrapper is problematic due to problems with a given object. . Attribute Specification Notes . Video codec | (Same as source) | See note | . File wrapper | DV (.dv) | See note | . Other characteristics | (Same as source) | If it is necessary to capture DV or HDV tapes via SDI (i.e. as V210/MOV), due to problematic tapes, deliverables must be transcoded and rewrapped as “.mkv”. | .

Audio channels | 2 (see examples) | . Closed captions* | CEA-608 (*if applicable) | . Service copies, video group 3: optical video disc . An individual service copy must be created for all discreet content. Example: If a disc contains two discreet videos, each with different display aspect ratios (i.e. 16:9 vs. 4:3), a separate service copy must be made for each video. | . | . . Additional video specifications . Anamorphic video . For service copies created from Anamorphic preservation masters, treat source as D1/DV NTSC or PAL Widescreen to produce a 16 x 9 service copy without padding. Pixel aspect ratio should be 1.21 (NTSC) / 1.46 (PAL). | . Complex audio configurations . 4 audio channels on source: If a source tape has 4 audio channels of identical content (i.e. 4 mics in a single room recording the same content), the 4 channels captured in the preservation master should be mixed down to 2 for the service copy. | If each audio channel contains different content, consult with NYPL for how to proceed. 2-channel Spanish / English language audio: If one channel contains Spanish dialogue and the other channel contains English dialogue, the audio content of the preservation master and the service copy must be identical. | . | Audible content in only one channel: If there is only audible content in a single channel of any number of channels in a source tape and preservation master, the channel containing audible content should be mapped for production of a 2-channel service copy to provide a better user experience. | . | . | . Timecode . Audible LTC Timecode should be eliminated, and “normal” content should be duplicated onto the second channel. | . Trimming of Heads and Tails . Color bars must not be trimmed. | Long tails of black / “snow” / unrecorded content may be trimmed after confirmation that there is no visible or audible recorded content. | Trimming must not result in an abrupt end of visible or audible content. | . . Audio media . . Deliberables . For each collection object, the following shall be produced: . One or more preservation master file(s) | One edit master file per preservation master | One metadata file per media file | For optical audio only, one CUE file per preservation master file | Image files as described | . . Capture tools . Preservation master and edit master files must be captured/encoded as Broadcast Wave Format (BWF), with embedded BEXT metadata (see “Embedded Metadata” section). . Files that exceed the Broadcast Wave Format 4GB file size limitation should be captured as RF64, with the same embedded metadata values. Post-capture, all Broadcast Wave and RF64 files should be transcoded to the FLAC codec and container, with embedded metadata and original modification times retained through the use of the FLAC Utility (https://xiph.org/flac/download.html) by following the command listed on the FFmprovisr website (https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/#flac-tool). Original capture as Wave64 (.w64) is not acceptable. . . Preservation master . Technical guidelines: The production of preservation master files will comply with the technical recommendations, practices and strategies outlined by the International Association of Audiovisual Archives | Strategic guidelines - IASA-TC 03, version 3: The production of preservation master files will comply with the ethical recommendations, practices and strategies outlined by the International Association of Audiovisual Archives. | Optimal signal extraction from analog sources seeks to be complete, and includes the transfer of the “lead-in” and “play-out” portions of a recording. | Analog signals will be converted to a digital bitstream by means of an Analog-to-Digital converter which complies with the specifications in FADGI’s Audio Analog-to-Digital Converter Performance Specification and Test Method. | No signal processing will be applied to the Analog-to-Digital converter’s digital bitstream, including, but not limited to equalization, level adjustment, dither, noise reduction. | . Signal Extraction . Signal extraction from analog original audio recordings will comply with the technical recommendations, practices and strategies outlined by the International Association of Audiovisual Archives. | Optimal signal extraction for the production of preservation master files should aim to capture the complete dynamic and frequency ranges of the original recording. | Signal extraction must be carried out using the equipment and accessories that are appropriate and intended for the original format characteristics. Example: a full-track mono recording on an open reel audio tape must be transferred using a full-track audio head (rather than a stereo head). | If this is not possible, provide an explicit proposal for work, subject to NYPL approval. | . | An optimal signal extraction from the original recording will be a flat (unmodified) transfer, free of signal processing, equalization, level adjustment, noise reduction, etc. Exceptions would include: de-emphasis of a recording’s stated pre-emphasis (playback equalization) | decoding of a recording’s stated noise-reduction encoding | Optimal signal extraction from original sources includes the extraction of the intended signal, along with any unintended signal (such as artifacts and anomalies in the signal associated with the inherent limitations of historic recording technologies). | Preservation master files may be one or two-channel (interleaved), and the configuration employed will be determined by the needs of the original recording. | Levels may be adjusted ONLY if there is severe distortion or digital clipping from the source, and this adjustment must be noted clearly in the metadata. | If a sync tone is present (i.e. Pilottone), tone must be captured or resolved. | For all grooved media, preservation master files must include the “needle-drop” and “needle-lift”. | . | . Special circumstances and object-file relationships . Faces: In general, one preservation master file will be generated for each physically or technically discrete recording area of the original object. For example, each side of an audio cassette or disc will be recorded as a separate preservation master file, identified with a designated Face number. | . | Considerations and circumstances that impact the number of preservation masters generated for each physical object, and/or for each discrete recording area: For an object which is found to have content recorded both forwards and backwards on the same Face, a second Face may be created for the reversed content to be recorded in the proper direction. | Region: For an object with regions recorded at different speeds or sampling rates, a separate preservation master must be created for each Region (filename_v01f01r01_pm). . File overlap: Speed Changes: If multiple preservation masters are created for a single recording due to speed changes, the cut should be made at a logical break in the audible content (if at all possible), and there must be exactly 5 seconds of audible content overlapping between the tail of the first preservation master and the head of the following PM so that the regions may be recombined in the future if necessary. | Sampling Rate Changes: If a digital source object has been recorded at multiple sampling rates, a separate preservation master must be created for each region. These regions do not need to overlap, but please include a note listing the timestamp on the source object where each region begins. | . | . | . | . Embedded metadata . BEXT metadata must be embedded in each audio file upon capturing to WAV. See Metadata section for details. . Preservation master file specifications: audio group 1: analog magnetic .

All EQ curves should be noted in the metadata digitization process notes. | . | Equipment NYPL requires either the Time-Step line of phono EQs, or the KAB Souvenir Equalizer. Owl EQs are not acceptable due to the age, added noise floor, and lack of versatility needed for our collections. Other phono EQs may be submitted for approval. | . | All discs should be transferred with the cartridge switched to “lateral” unless otherwise indicated on the label. | A full complement of stylus shapes and sizes should be on-hand at the vendor transfer station, and he best sounding size/shape stylus used for transfer should be noted in the metadata digitization process notes. * Modern LP styli must not be used to transfer shellac, shellac-vinyl compound, or early vinyl discs. | Tone arm requirements: * Arm must be long enough to comfortably reach the outer grooves. * Arm should be vertically adjustable to accommodate the various thicknesses of pressings. * During playback, the angle of the tonearm from front to back should be perfectly parallel in relationship to the disc while it is playing. | While playing a face, for any speed changes or instances where the stylus has to be repositioned to continue playing, a separate preservation master must be created for each Region. If the stylus skips, attempt to correct and retransfer the area before and after, add this note into the metadata along with time stamp.

Pull a small selection of film containers from staging area to assess and bring to workstation | Prepare a takeup reel and core for the size film you will assess. | Each film will have a CMS ID. In CMS, navigate to film layout and search for the CMS ID of the film you will assess. | Add 10 ft of leader to first portion of film encountered (may be head or tail) - try to determine if head or tail. Match perforations. | Label leader according to specifications (CMS ID [large space] HEAD / TAIL) | If film is safe to inspect with a footage counter, prepare the footage counter and begin inspecting the film. | Enter inspection data to the layout while doing inspection. Complete ALL fields that are applicable. Ask for help with any unfamiliar fields or information. Do not guess. Correct any incorrect data entered by other staff (titles, format, etc). 8.IMPORTANT: Select the “Inspected” checkbox when finished. | Add leader to end of roll (may be head or tail), label accordingly. 10.If wind is not flat, re-wind to obtain a flat roll (unless film is so fragile that more winding may damage the roll or take an excessive amount of time/effort). 11.Double check your data entry and move on to the next film. 12.When a container is complete (all items are assesed within container): If Record Carton, add a yellow dot sticker to the bottom left corner of the front of the box; if film cannister, add yellow dot sticker to left of container barcode. | Conduct a search for all items inspected by you on the date you are working - do a final check to make sure no data is missing. (How to: Ctrl+F, select the “inspected” checkbox in Find mode, enter your username in the ‘inspectedBy’ field, hit Return) | Bring boxes to designated ‘completed films’ storage area. | Update container location in AMI Master spreadsheet. AMI Master spreadsheet | Movement &amp; Staging . Migration from Special Formats Processing to PAMI Film Assessment Staging Boxes of film that are inventoried and ready to inspect are brought to room 306 from the 2nd floor vault each week, or as needed to maintain constant workflow. | Assessment staff migrate only the number of boxes they can assess within a reasonable amount of time (1-2 days), to limit the number of items that are in transit (i.e. not identified in a specific building location in CMS). | Inspected films are placed on designated shelves in 306 or returned to the area in 210 that is designated for assessed film (this location may be updated on a monthly bases as vault as per vault space needs). | . | . Inventory &amp; Inspection Procedures . Inspection Supplies . Box labels / Archival labels | Barcode labels | CMS labels (blank) &amp; printed | Barcode labels (blank, for duplicating) | . Definitions . Container label: the rectangular archival / NYPL label applied to either Record Carton boxes or Film Canisters (when a film can does not fit into an archival box). | CMS label: label or ID number applied or written on individual items /cans of film, and to film leader heads and tails. | . Film Staging . Pre-inventoried film will be placed by SFP on Row 46, shelves 1796-1802 of the 2nd floor vault. | Assessed film, ready for ReCAP (or destination TBD) will be staged in the 306 cage until further notice. | . Film Assessment Overview . CMS Inventory Instructions for Film Assessment . Non-inventoried items . Open CMS, navigate to Media Originals layout | Create a new item record using your allotted CMS ID # | Rehouse ephemera as necessary | Label the film can with new CMS ID # &amp; barcode | Complete all bibliographic / standard CMS inventory fields | Switch to CMS film layout (navigate to the item record you were working on…) | Inspect film on rewind bench and complete all Film Assessment fields Add 10ft of leader to head &amp; tail, label leader “head” or “tail” with CMS ID #. If leader is already present, is in good condition, and is at least 10ft long each at head and/or tail, existing leader may be used for labeling with CMS# - no additional leader is necessary. | . | Assess condition and make repairs as necessary | Identify film element type &amp; provide notes when standard fields are not sufficient | Wind onto core and leave film wound opposite from original orientation. | . | Apply a yellow “dot” sticker to the bottom left corner of an RC or to the left of the barcode on a film canister spine. | Place film can / box of film on “Completed Films” shelves in 306 cage when finished. | . Inventoried Items . Open CMS, navigate to Media Originals layout | Find existing item record using CMS ID or item barcode | Rehouse item and any accompanying ephemera as necessary. If rehoused, label the new film can with CMS ID &amp; barcode Duplicate container and CMS ID labels as necessary | . | Switch to CMS film layout (navigate to the item record you were working on…) | Inspect film on rewind bench and complete all Film Assessment fields Add 10ft of leader to head &amp; tail | Assess condition and make repairs as necessary | Identify film element type &amp; provide Notes when standard fields are not sufficient | . | Apply a yellow “dot” sticker to the bottom left corner of an RC or to the left of the barcode on a film canister spine. | Place film on “Completed Films” shelf in 306 cage when finished. | . Inspection Criteria &amp; Guidelines . Shrinkage measurement: Measure at Head, Middle, and Tail, and enter the average of the three measurements into CMS. | . | Splices: Condition - Splices: 0: no splices | 1: 1 - 5 splices | 2: 6 - 10 splices | 3: More than 10 splices | . | During inspection, test the integrity any existing splices. Repair any weak, broken, or deteriorating splices. | If you encounter excessive deteriorating splices, do not continue hand-inspection. See below. | . | Inspection Time per object: Spend no more than 30min per film, including administrative work (creating box labels, CMS records, etc). | . | If a film is too far gone and would require more than 30min work, rewind without hand-inspecting, enter ‘not fully inspected’ into notes field, provide a footage estimate and any other information obtained, and move on. | Vinegar &amp; mold: Temporary storage on designated shelf in 306 cage unless item is severely toxic / hazardous. | Move to disaster room if moldy / infested / hazardous. | . | Camera Original material Handling Do not put camera original on a footage counter - use footage ruler for estimate | . | Sealed unprocessed film Do not open any cans that are tightly sealed closed with tape (i.e. intentionally sealed shut) - mark film as ‘unprocessed film stock’ and note that film was not fully assessed. Provide footage estimate count based on can size. | . | Ephemera: Paper ephemera (i.e. lab notes, photographs, pamphlets, hand-written notes, and narrative / descriptive documents that are inside or adhered to original housings) must be either removed or photocopied and retained in a separate file folder. Fragile original documentation may be protected with poly-sleeves | Non-original documentation (i.e. photocopies of annotations written on housings or adhesive notes that cannot safely be removed from housings) does not need to be in poly-sleeves, they can go straight into the file folders. | Some Examples: | . | . | . Scenario Action Notes . A commercially printed adhesive label that describes the full content of a film, placed on the inside of a can and not easily removable | Photocopy this inner label, as it may more accurately describe the content than any cataloger (who may not be familiar with or able to research the content / film). Place copy in file. | Copy does not require poly-sleeve | . A very small handwritten note on thin, fragile paper or paper with adhesive (Post-It) | Small poly-sleeve, inside file folder |   | . A photographic print or other glossy paper ephemera | Poly-sleeve, inside file folder |   | . A film lab report describing camera roll numbers and key codes, and date of development | Place ephemera into archival file folder, without a poly-sleeve |   | . Short annotation on exterior of can, such as “Sunrise - R1 of 2” | Transcribe these notes in the ‘Notes” field of CMS | Do not photocopy | . Printed label with address of production company and title of film | Transcribe label content into “Title” and “Notes” |   | . Each CMS object gets it’s own folder. Label the folder in the upper-left hand corner - in pencil - with the item’s 3-letter division code (“DAN”) followed by the CMS ID. Example: DAN 123456 | If used, poly-sleeves should be labeled with the original object’s CMS number. The poly-sleeve should be labeled on the outside with archival marker. Do not write on any original ephemera (writing on photocopies is acceptable). | When inspection if the item is complete, place the file folder into a designated archival file box, in numeric order. | Each workstation is provided two gray boxes - when one is full, bring the box to SFP Manager or leave it on SFP Manager’s office table with a note (“film assessment ephemera”) and continue collecting in your free box. | SFP Manager will enter ephemera into a data system maintained by SFP. | When SFP Manager is done entering the ephemera into the data system, they will leave the empty box in their office, where it may be retrieved when the next box of ephemera is brought in. | . | . Labeling Procedures . CMS Containers (Record Cartons or Film Canisters) Film Canisters and Boxes (boxes of any type - record carton / small box etc.) receive container labels (in addition to a barcode &amp; CMS ID label): | To create a container label: CMS Home &gt; “Search / Edit” | Identify the department collection ID and Search “Collection Name” and “Collection Number” | Upon completing the search, navigate to “Items” in the top menu (this will bring you to the list of containers) | CURRENT PRACTICE (2018): Note: In the context of container labeling, there are only two relevant container types: “film canister” vs. non-film-canister (i.e. RC, Audio box, etc.). In reality, there are several container types, but for these purposes, let’s pretend there are only 2, mentioned above. | non-film-canister containers are sorted sequentially, and appear in the list before all of the “film canister”s. Scroll to where the non-film-canisters end, take note of the last container number. | Then, scroll to where the film canisters end, compare the previous number to the last film canister number. If the last film canister number is greater than the last non-film-canister number, use the number that follows the film canister number; if the non-film-canister number is still greater than the last film canister number, use the number that follows the non-film-canister number. | . | . | . | Small Cans / Boxed Cans If can fits in a box, the film can does not get a container label - the box receives a container label and the can is assigned a CMS number. | . | Duplicating existing can labels: Use the barcode duplicator to create a new barcode label if an item must be rehoused to a new can. | . | Film leader Using the footage counter to measure your leader, apply 10ft of leader to head and tail of each film. | In marker, hand-write the items’ CMS ID number on the head and tail leader of each film. Example: CMS# 123456 HEAD | . | . Workstation Layout &amp; Specifications . 4 stations * | .",

Search entire inventory sheet for the described content and make edits as instructed: . Face: mainly applies to audio; delete contents for other media types (optical video that has faces will just need to be fixed by vendors; this will be rare) | Diameter: delete any 0 values (0 is not a valid diameter) | Stock length (minutes): delete all column contents (values are inconsistent - some say “10min” “10” “10 minutes” “10:00:00” etc. and would mess up the vendor’s import) | Metadata version: add current version (per May 2017 = 2.0.0) | Media Type: Use the Filter function to identify and narrow down format types, and update values to match required JSON schema values for ‘source.object.type’:(Example: video cassette becomes video cassette analog or video cassette digital depending on what format the video is). Use Filter to double-check once your are done that all values in that column adhere to the schema. Find &amp; Replace…: . | Select “search using regular expressions” Select “this sheet” (for the sheet you’re working on), | Review the specific ranges mentioned below and find/replace as described: | . | Find the following characters… double quotations: “ (replace with two single-quotes placed side by side, without spaces (Example: Audio Reel 10&quot; becomes Audio Reel 10&#39;&#39;) | semicolon: ; (replace with-) | backslash: (replace with -) | new line: n (replace with -) | vertical tab: v (replace with -) | tab: t (replace with -) | carriage return: r (replace with -) | . | Double check to make sure you replaced all values as needed (sometimes the first one you find is skipped) | . Media Inventory &amp; Physical Preparation . Box Check-Out: The template for the box check-out sheet is included in the Vendor Project Worksheet template. When you import the CMS batch export data, the ‘box-barcode-list’ tab in that sheet should be autopopulated using the values from the ‘metadataInventory’ tab. Do not alter the locked sheets. | the ‘box-check-out’ and ‘box-check-in’ tabs are pre-filled with formulas that should pull the box barcodes from the auto-populated list. The check-out/in sheets may need to have rows added to them in order to accommodate the actual number of boxes that exist in the project. To do this, ‘add rows’ and drag drag formulas in columns A &amp; B down to the last row, so that all formulas are working properly for all rows. Test by entering in valid and invalid barcodes into the column. | Boxes are pulled by SFP team &amp; PAMI staff by staging boxes on carts to prepare for movement. | Once a cart is full and ready to move, PAMI Media Preservation Coordinator or Assistant scans box barcodes into the prepared Box Check-Out sheet - before they are moved to LSC room 306. The check-out sheet confirms that the scanned barcode matches the list of barcodes that is expected from the finalized Metadata Inventory in the Vendor Project Worksheet. If any discrepancies occur, box barcodes must be checked against the metadataInventory spreadsheet tab. | . | Boxes on carts are brought to LSC room 306 and palletized; wrapp 2 with plastic if possible to give shippers a head start; | . Box Check-Out/In Google Sheet Color-Coding Guide . Column B (“Inventory Box Barcodes Confirmation”) value defaults to the value “CHECK BARCODE”. Therefor, if you scan a box and the barcode is not on the expected barcode list, Column B will remain colored red with the CHECK BARCODE value, instructing you to double-check the barcode. | If Column B turns orange, it means that you have already scanned that box barcode, or there is a duplicated barcode, and you must double check this box. | If Column B returns the same barcode number you just scanned, then all is well. Proceed with barcode-scanning. | . Shipping Coordination . See Shipping. . Quality Control . See Quality Control workflow documentation . Project Close-Out . Project Summaries .

Quality Control Overview . Quality control (QC) is conducted in accordance with best practices to ensure that deliverables generated for preservation and access meet our technical specifications, metadata requirements, and adhere to best practices for handling and digitization of NYPL’s audiovisual collections. . Our QC workflow is currently comprised of the following processes: . Fixity check: custom scripts that incorporate Bagit.py | JSON validation using ajv | MediaConch specification conformance check | Manual bag, content, &amp; metadata inspection | . Our QC workflows vary slightly between Vendor and In-House deliverables, so the following handbook is divided to reflect that. The following sections will provide step-by-step instructions for carrying out our QC processes. . Vendor Deliverables . For Vendor deliverables, QC is performed directly on hard-drives (with the exception of audio deliverables that can be migrated to our server and made accessible to the audio engineers). . Mounting Drives Read-Only . The most important step during QC is to mount your drive(s) Read-Only. . JSON Validation . Run the following command(s) in Terminal to check if JSON is valid against the appropriate schema. . Media specification validation (MediaConch) . Use either MediaConch CLI or MediaConch GUI to make sure files meet NYPL specifications. . Generating a QC list . Use Terminal to generate a QC list for each drive you are QCing by following the steps outlined here. . Content Inspection . Content inspection can be completed either on ICC or on the drive by following the steps outlined here. . Locate &amp; Open QC log . Each QC log should be easily found linked in Google Drive as an attachment in the Trello Card for the batch you are inspecting. If not, check with MPA. Tip: you can search for the drive ID / work order ID in the Trello search box. . Use the list of files that appears in the Google Sheet QC log (in the QClog tab) as your list of files to check. | Drop down menus are available for noting specific identifiable errors, and there is a free-text field for general notes. | . Spot Checking Content &amp; JSON . Use a text-editor (Atom / Notepad / Text Edit etc.) to open and inspect JSON files. . Logging QC Failures &amp; Flags . Use this list of definitions to review and mark-off the items listed in the QC log. . Media Ingest Preparation . Follow these steps to prepare media for ingest. . Tools . See PAMI Tools List for descriptions, usage, and installation instructions .",

Things to consider when working with audio files: No 5 second overlap between heads and tails of Parts or Regions | Reversed content that was not transferred as a separate region | Tip: For a quick check of the entire drive for objects with Regions, grep the directory for “p01” or “r01” | . | Things to consider when working with video files: Service Copy plays and does not contain transcoding errors / is not corrupt. | . | . | . | . Logging QC Failures &amp; Flags . Use the Definitions below to review and mark-off the items listed in the QC log. . Be as concise as possible when noting questions and errors, so MPA does not have to double-check or clarify with you before compiling notes for Vendors. | Feel free to add rows for additional assets if you encounter more errors when troubleshooting. Rows are ‘per bag’. | When QC is complete, send an email to notify MPA / Asst Mgr. that there are some items to review. They will compile all notes for a shipment into a single email and communicate to the vendor. Note: Try to troubleshoot errors to make sure you’re not missing something about the nature of the tape that would impact the quality or structure of the file or metadata, e.g. if it was a very poor quality tape and they baked it twice and cleaned it and tried it on multiple machines. | . Definitions . Question: A question which will help determine whether an item should be reworked or not. Example: Freeze frame at the head of the Preservation Master, not noted in the JSON signalNotes. Is this freeze-frame recorded in on-tape? | . | Flag: A moderate or minor error that is concerning but that DOES NOT require rework, but does require. Examples: An audio Edit Master was not levelled-out. The volume level is the same as the Preservation Master, which is lower than the ideal listening volume. | Audio channels in a video Service Copy were not mixed down the audio from the single channel audible in the Preservation Master, so Service Copy only has one channel of audible content. | . | Fail: A severe, systematic, or critical error that you think will most likely require retransfer, updating of metadata, and/or rebagging. Examples: The metadata for a video asset describes audible content, but the Preservation Master and Service Copy do not have audio. | An audio asset appears to sound entirely backwards (reversed content on a single face -f01 -was not split out into a separate Face -f02-) | . | Pass No errors, or any errors listed in the notes are inconsequential, inherent to tape, or only included as supplemental information for future cataloger inquiries. Urgent / Systematic errors . | If you notice that there is something consistently and terribly wrong with many files in a row, please notify MPA / Asst. Mgr immediately so we can notify vendor and avoid replicating the error in future deliverables ASAP. (e.g. the ’barcode’ field in the JSON files is consistently “000000000”, or the ‘duration’ values are all wrong, or every value for ‘filename’ is the same across an entire batch.) | .

Rsyncing JSON and JPEGS: . rsync -rtv /DRIVEID/*/*/data/*/*.json /path/to/destination . rsync -rtv /DRIVEID/*/*/data/*/*.jpg /path/to/destination . Occasionally, this will result in an “argument list too long” error (mostly a problem with audio drives, which can contain thousands and thousands of files). In these cases, the following will work: . find DRIVEID/ -name &#39;*.json&#39; -exec rsync -rtv --progress {} /path/to/destination &#39;;&#39; . find DRIVEID/ -name &#39;*.jpg&#39; -exec rsync -rtv --progress {} /path/to/destination &#39;;&#39; .

Brew cask install fuse . | Brew install ntfs3g . | . Commands . The following commands come in handy when troubleshooting specific errors, json failures, or preparing a machine for doing QC work. . Mounting Drives Read-Only . The most important step during QC. . Open Terminal | Open Disk Utility | Plug in/turn on hard drive | Unmount using Disk Utility (or using Terminal command ‘umount’) | Make note of diskID: In Disk utility, click “info” or select the drive on the list and type ‘command+i’ or use Terminal command ‘list’ | . | . | In Terminal, type the following, where “diskID” = the diskID you just found (i.e. disk1s2): Diskutil mount readOnly diskID | . | Your disk should be mounted read-only now | . JSON Validation . Run the following command(s) in Terminal to check if JSON is valid against schema cd path/to/ami-metadata | ajv validate -s path/to/versions/#.#/schema/digitized.json -r &quot;versions/#.#/schema/*.json&quot; -d &quot;dir_of_bags/*/data/*/*.json&quot; | Select entire output of validation and export as DRIVEID_jsonvalidationlog.txt into log folder | grep -o -c -i -h -r invalid  path/to/ICC/Logs/Project/DRIVEID_jsonvalidationlog.txt | . | JSON invalid?: Run validation on individual failed files to retrieve specific errors and create a list to send failure report to vendor. To check for further errors, you must copy the file, fix the first error on the copy version, and validate the copy to see if more errors pop up - the validator will fail a file at the first error it encounters and stop there. | . | . | . Creating New HDmanifests . These commands will create manifests for all files, excluding all subdirectories and BagIt related files. You can add/remove file types within the -iname flags to include or exclude other types. . Create a new HDmanifest for an Audio directory . cd /Volumes/DRIVEID | find Audio/ -type f ( -iname &quot;*.wav&quot; -or -iname &quot;*.json&quot; ) &gt; path/to/dest.csv | . Create a new HDmanifest for an Video directory . cd /Volumes/DRIVEID | find Video/ -type f ( -iname &quot;*.mkv&quot; -or -iname &quot;*.mp4&quot; -or -iname &quot;*.json&quot; ) &gt; path/to/dest.csv | . Parsing Files and Reports . Move JSON / JPGs . rsync -rtv /DRIVEID/*/data/*/*.json /path/to/destination . | rsync -rtv /DRIVEID/*/*/data/*/*.jpg /path/to/destination . | . Occasionally, this will result in an “argument list too long” error (mostly a problem with audio drives, which can contain thousands and thousands of files). In these cases, the following will work: . find DRIVEID/ -iname &#39;*.json&#39; -exec rsync -rtv --progress {} /path/to/destination &#39;;&#39; . | find DRIVEID/ -iname &#39;*.jpg&#39; -exec rsync -rtv --progress {} /path/to/destination &#39;;&#39; . | . Grep JSON . The Grep tool can be used for many things, including: . Parsing the ‘Logs’ folder on ICC to find the drive that contains a certain Bag | Performing mass fixes on specific recurring errors | Identifying all files with a known error, to make a list of things to fix / rework | . grep -i -H -R &quot;someString&quot; Volumes/HardDrive/*/*/data/*/*.json . OR . Cd dir/of/bags/ . find . -name &quot;*.json&quot; | xargs grep &quot;audio cassette digital&quot; . This recursively searches for specific text in a json file and returns the line of text as well as the filename and path containing the text. Use * to mark any directories that will have variable names (such as objects / bags) . Grep Validation Logs . The following are examples for parsing the json validation log and bag validation log for invalid objects. . grep -i -H -R &quot;invalid&quot; path/to/jsonvalidationlog.txt . | grep -i -H -R &quot;invalid&quot; path/to/validationLogFile.log . | . Google Sheet formulas: . Return content/value after ‘nth’ character in a cell . =RIGHT(A1,LEN(A1)-5) (where A1 is the source cell. Adjust number of characters from “-5” to match the number of characters you want to omit from new cell) . Flag items that aren’t in a specified range . Insert the following formula next to a cell you’d like to confirm is in a given column. If the cell is not in the given column, it will return the value of that cell (which would enable you to create a filtered list of all items that show up as missing from the column). =IF(COUNTIF($C:$C, $B4)=0, B4, &quot;&quot;) . Color-code duplicates in a range of columns . Select range of columns (this works best with a small rage, where there are very few columns to consider, like 2) | ctrl-click and select conditional formatting for just that range. | Use custom formula below &amp; set desired color of cell / formatting (where A:B is the range - adjust for different ranges): | . =COUNTIF($A$1:$B$1031, INDIRECT(ADDRESS(ROW(), COLUMN(), 4))) &gt; 1 . Good for performing check-in of physical assets (to confirm that the original list of items has been scanned | Finding duplicates between two lists, i.e. the DNC list from one batch to another to make sure projects aren’t getting mixed up | Checking between a list of items that have been QC’d vs total items | . Creating a filtered list divided by a number (for 10%, 20% etc.) . Query for cell content . =QUERY( C1:C, &quot;Select C Where C contains &#39;f01r01_pm.wav&#39; &quot; ) Syntax = ([range], “Select [column in range] Where [same column in range] contains ‘[string]’ ” ) | . | . Working with tars . For many years, the standard PAMI workflow was to tar (create a (t)ape (ar)chive, or “tarball”) any complexly structured AMI deliverables. Typically, this was used for born digital original documentation, and by creating a singular file (with a .tar extension) that could stand in for multiple files and directories, we were able to achieve certain measure of control, consistency, and ease of movement/storage. The tar manual (man tar) offers a full list of options/flags, but here are some helpful commands: . Creating tars . To create a tarball without compression: . tar -cvf mytar.tar input_directory . To create a tarball with gzip compression: . tar -czvf mytar.tar input_directory . The -c flag specifies the creation of a tar, -v the verbose output printed to your terminal window, -z the gzip compression, and -f the specified file that will be written to or read from. . Examining tars . To get a list of all files and directories within a tar (with permissions and file sizes): . tar -tvf mytar.tar . Without permissions and file sizes: . tar -tf mytar.tar . To list all files (but not directories): . tar -tvf --exclude=&quot;.*&quot; mytar.tar . Batching (output to csv): . find ExcelBornDigital/ -name &#39;*.tar&#39; -exec tar -tzf {} --exclude=&quot;.*&quot; &#39;;&#39; &gt; /Users/pamiaudio/Desktop/ICA_borndigital.csv . Extracting files from tars . To extract a file from a tar: . cd into the directory in which you’d like to copy the file, and . tar -xvf mytar.tar myfile.ext . Some things to note: . The tar will still be intact; the file will simply be copied to your chosen location | You’ll need the full file path (which you can get by using the -tf command) | Tar is picky about spaces, so you may need to transform something like this: Volumes/lpa/Working Storage/Transfer/2 - Ready for Finishing/zUnprocessedOrigidocsDAN/myd_mgzidvd57093_v01/Capture Scratch/Alvin Ailey 2012/CAM A4.mov . | To something like this: Volumes/lpa/Working Storage/Transfer/2 - Ready for Finishing/zUnprocessedOrigidocsDAN/myd_mgzidvd57093_v01/Capture Scratch/Alvin Ailey 2012/CAM A4.mov . | .",
