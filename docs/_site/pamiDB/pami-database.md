## Project Structure
* **Projects:** Within PAMI, a project describes reformatting activity on a batch of media, initiated by either on-going the AMI Initiative or Public Orders (patron or donor requests).
* **Work Orders:** Work Orders are a subdivision of a project, but a project may consist of one or many Work Order (many in-house Projects consist of only one Work Order, but most Contract / Vendor projects consist of multiple Work Orders due to the high-volume of media).
* **Deliverables:** Deliverable requirements for in-house vs. contract reformatting work vary slightly.
  * Vendor deliverable requirements are defined on the [ami-specifications](https://github.com/NYPL/ami-specifications/) repo.
  * In-house deliverable requirements documentation is pending.

## Project Creation
* Digitization batch inventory is generated by Special Formats Processing, exported from CMS, and emailed to PAMI manager.
* PAMI ID is generated in database and used to begin all documentation. The following preparatory documents are stored in AMI folders on Google Drive
  * Statement of Work
  * Vendor Project Worksheet & Metadata Inventory
  * Shipping Document

## Project Preparation and Logistics
* Vendor Project Worksheet
  * Contains:

## Project tracking
### Vendor Shipments
* Upon arrival, all deliverables (hard drive or network-based shipments) are logged in the [AMI Vendor Project Tracking sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZeF6vGE1TqLnKaNjZFSIvjyKhYBt38nBcZDHyD_saPo/edit#gid=1908905860) document.

### Trello
* [Trello](https://trello.com/nyplamipreservationlabs) is used to track progress on both in-house and vendor work order QC and Ingest progress.

### Google Drive
* AMI Google Team Drive is used for storing and sharing internal documents related to AMI work (specific folders are shared as needed with staff).

## Project Close-Out
### Project Summaries
* Compiling Manifests & Reports
  * **Capture Issues:** Find & delete the following characters in the vendor's DNC reports & HDmanifests
    - vertical tab ```\v```
    - tab ```\t```
    - carriage return ```\r```
    - new line [similar to carriage return but they both appeared separately] ```\n```

* DNC object management
  * Separate the items by original project fund (pami work orders should at a minimum be separated by project fund). Example: Slifka, Mellon. No need to separate by unit or research center.
  * Manager will forward the DNC list separately, and you can review to identify what should be sent to PAMI. Manager will pull objects and box-up according to project fund. On return, media goes back into they're original boxes.
  * For PAMI metadata, pull  item records from the original metadata inventory from initial project and create internal db records (remembering to change the cms project code).
  CMS:
    * CMS project code: PAMI
    * CMS title / description: DNC - [fund name]
  ....EXAMPLE: dnc - mellon
  CMS batch #:... next available sequential ## (can we put a placeholder in PAMI work orders until this is ready?)
